# CSE-6740-Computational_Data_Analysis  @ GaTech
Focus on machine learning algorithms, statistical learning and data mining and their implementation.<br>
Topics in this course include mathematical principles and programming implementation of
* Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (SVM, clustering, logistic regression, regression, reinforcement learning etc.)
* Statitical learning (bayesian statistics, density estimation, EM algorithm, kernel methods, Markov models etc.)
* Feature selection(information theory)
* Neural networks.
